# Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. It includes examples using multiple datasets, including the Hayes-Roth, Car Evaluation, and Breast Cancer datasets.

## Introduction

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes independence among predictors.

## Datasets

- **Hayes-Roth Dataset**: Used to demonstrate the classification of individuals based on their characteristics.
- **Car Evaluation Dataset**: Utilized to classify cars into different categories based on their features.
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Employed to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on cell attributes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Setup and Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the notebook directory. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Running the Notebook

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can start the Jupyter notebook server using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `Naive Bayes.ipynb` file in the Jupyter UI to open and run the notebook.

## Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

- Data loading and preprocessing functions.
- Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Application of the classifier to the datasets mentioned.
